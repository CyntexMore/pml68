I'm a *simple* man with a *simple* goal.

## To take over the world

I don't quite understand why you're looking at my profile, but the only repo I have that isn't ***utterly*** **useless** is [`pml68/suckless-setup`](https://github.com/pml68/suckless-setup)

If, for some reason, you **still** want to look at any other project of mine, check out [`Olah-Barbershop`](https://github.com/Olah-Barbershop) (hopefully I have somewhat finished the app and uploaded it by the time you're looking at this)

## School project

The previously mentioned [Ol√°h Barbershop](https://linktr.ee/olahbarbershop), a non-existent company.
